The data is often used to remember the client when the client returns to the hosted application at a later date. A session cookie is a special type of cookie used to remember the client during the session. The cookie will contain the session identifier (ID) and may contain authentication data to the hosted application. To protect this data from easily being compromised, the cookie must be encrypted. \n\nWhen a cookie is sent encrypted via SSL/TLS, an attacker must spend a great deal of time and resources to decrypt the cookie. If, along with encryption, the cookie is compressed, the attacker can now use a combination of plaintext injection and inadvertent information leakage through data compression to reduce the time needed to decrypt the cookie. This attack is called Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy (CRIME). \n\nCookies shared between the web server and the client when encrypted should not also be compressed.\n\nA cookie can be read by client-side scripts easily if cookie properties are not set properly. By allowing cookies to be read by the client-side scripts, information such as session identifiers could be compromised and used by an attacker who intercepts the cookie. Setting cookie properties (i.e. HttpOnly property) to disallow client-side scripts from reading cookies better protects the information inside the cookie.\"\n  desc 'check', 'Note: If the server being reviewed is a public IIS 8.5 web server, this is Not Applicable.\nNote: If the server being reviewed is hosting WSUS, this is Not Applicable.\nNote: If the server being reviewed is hosting SharePoint, this is Not Applicable.\nNote: If SSL is installed on load balancer/proxy server through which traffic is routed to the IIS 8.5 server, and the IIS 8.5 server receives traffic from the load balancer/proxy server, the SSL requirement must be met on the load balancer/proxy server.\n\nFollow the procedures below for each site hosted on the IIS 8.5 web server:\n\nAccess the IIS 8.5 Manager.\nUnder the \"Management\" section, double-click the \"Configuration Editor\" icon.\nFrom the \"Section:\" drop-down list, select \"system.web/httpCookies\".\nVerify the \"require SSL\" is set to \"True\".\nFrom the \"Section:\" drop-down list, select \"system.web/sessionState\".\nVerify the \"compressionEnabled\" is set to \"False\".\n\nIf both the \"system.web/httpCookies:require SSL\" is set to \"True\" and the \"system.web/sessionState:compressionEnabled\" is set to \"False\", this is not a finding.'\n  desc 'fix', 'Follow the procedures below for each site hosted on the IIS 8.5 web server:\n\nAccess the IIS 8.5 Manager.\nUnder \"Management\" section, double-click the \"Configuration Editor” icon.\nNote: If the server being reviewed is a public IIS 8.5 web server, this is Not Applicable.\n\nFollow the procedures below for each site hosted on the IIS 8.5 web server:\n\nAccess the IIS 8.5 Manager.\nUnder \"Management\" section, double-click the \"Configuration Editor\" icon.\nFrom the \"Section:\" drop-down list, select \"system.web/httpCookies\".\nSet the \"require SSL\" to \"True\".\nFrom the \"Section:\" drop-down list, select \"system.web/sessionState\".\nSet the \"compressionEnabled\" to \"False\".\nSelect \"Apply\" from the \"Actions\" pane.'\n  impact 0.5\n  ref 'DPMS Target Microsoft IIS 8.5 Site'\n  tag gtitle: 'SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000154'\n  tag satisfies: ['SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000154', 'SRG-APP-000439-SSR-000155', 'SRG-APP-000439-WSR-000153']\n  tag gid: 'V-214482'\n  tag rid: 'SV-214482r903100_rule'\n  tag stig_id: 'IISW-SI-000246'\n  tag fix_id: 'F-15689r903099_fix'\n  tag cci: ['CCI-002418']\n  tag nist: ['SC-8']\n  tag 'false_negatives'\n  tag 'false_positives'\n  tag 'documentable'\n  tag 'mitigations'\n  tag 'severity_override_guidance'\n  tag 'potential_impacts'\n  tag 'third_party_tools'\n  tag 'mitigation_controls'\n  tag 'responsibility'\n  tag 'ia_controls'\n  tag 'check'\n  tag 'fix'\n\n  get_names = command(\"Get-Website | select name | findstr /v 'name ---'\").stdout.strip.split(\"\\r\\n\")\n  get_compressionEnabled = command('Get-WebConfigurationProperty -pspath \"IIS:\\Sites\\*\" -Filter system.web/sessionState -name * | select -expand compressionEnabled').stdout.strip.split(\"\\r\\n\")\n\n  get_compressionEnabled.zip(get_names).each do |compressionEnabled, names|\n    n = names.strip\n\n    describe \"The IIS site: #{n} website compressionEnabled enabled setting\" do\n      subject { compressionEnabled }\n      it { should cmp 'False' }\n    end\n  end\n  if get_names.empty?\n    impact 0.0\n    desc 'There are no IIS sites configured hence the control is Not-Applicable'\n\n    describe 'No sites where found to be reviewed' do\n      skip 'No sites where found to be reviewed'\n    end\n  end\nend\n",

Vendors are constantly updating and patching their products to address newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Organizations (including any contractor to the organization) are required to promptly install security-relevant software updates (e.g., patches, service packs, and hot fixes). Flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, or information system error handling must also be addressed expeditiously.\n\nOrganization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software may vary based on a variety of factors including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw).\n\nThis requirement will apply to software patch management solutions used to install patches across the enclave and to applications themselves that are not part of that patch management solution. For example, many browsers today provide the capability to install their own patch software. Patch criticality, as well as system criticality will vary. Therefore, the tactical situations regarding the patch management process will also vary. This means that the time period used must be a configurable parameter. Time frames for application of security-relevant software updates may be dependent upon the Information Assurance Vulnerability Management (IAVM) process.\n\nThe application will be configured to check for and install security-relevant software updates within an identified time period from the availability of the update. The specific time period will be defined by an authoritative source (e.g., IAVM, CTOs, DTMs, and STIGs).'\n  desc 'check', 'IIS 8.5 is no longer supported by the vendor.

The biggest disadvantage to all three is the hijacking of a session along with all of the user's credentials.\n\nWhen the user authorization and identity information is stored on the server in a protected and encrypted database, the communication between the client and website will only send the session identifier, and the server can then retrieve user credentials for the session when needed.
